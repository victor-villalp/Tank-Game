## Student Name : Victor Villalpando
## Student ID : 916023568

IDE: IntelliJ Idea 2019.1 IDE
Version of Java: 11.0.1

## How to Import the Game
1. Clone or download the repo and open the project in IntelliJ.
2. Click on "File" and locate and click on "Project Structure."
3. Set "resources" folder as a resource folder.

## How to Run the Game 
Ideally, the game should run by simply double clicking on the jar file that was meant to be located in the "jar" folder, but I decided not to include such file beacuse it fails failed to read the Map.txt file during building. However, the game can be still played using IntelliJ. Open the project in the IDE and locate the main class (GameWorld), right clicking the class file and clicking "Run GameWorld.main()."

## Game Objective
Two tanks will attack each other until one of them stands.
1. Each player has 3 lives and 5 health points.
2. Bullets exert 1 damage point.
3. Players can destroy breakbale walls.
4. Each player can get an idtional life point by collecting a life power up.
